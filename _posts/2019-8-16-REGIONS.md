### Did you know? Regions are working in XAML!    
   
Hi folks,   
I just discovered thatâ€™s possible to use regions in XAML [#VS2017 â€“ About C# regions and now #Xaml regions also (What?!)](https://elbruno.com/2017/04/18/vs2017-about-c-regions-and-now-xaml-regions-also-what/?fbclid=IwAR3pZaFwPLziPsS6nSOTcxRcrVGjRMN1vliGoxznbEYPIci0c9yraoloCl0). Following the original article, it seems that there are some discussions about the benefits of regions. I wonâ€™t go further, apparently there are already many discussions on the net.
  
Personally, I find regions quite useful if used with parsimony. Especially when discovering code from a colleague or some old code from me. But thatâ€™s nearly the same, as today Iâ€™m not writing code the same manner as yesterday, hopefully better ðŸ˜‰ 
  
Until today I really missed it in XAML. In XAML itâ€™s less easy to make code refactoring and things tend to be very verbose. So, itâ€™s great (old) news for me and perhaps some other guys who missed it also.
   
But back to the basics: What is it about. Itâ€™s all about grouping code and having a nice resumÃ© instead:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2019-8-16-REGIONS(Open).png)  
   
Shows up as:   
   
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2019-8-16-REGIONS(Closed).png)  
   
The good news is: If you donâ€™t like it, just leave it and read it like any other comment in the code. There is no obligation to click on it ðŸ˜‰   
   
XAML regions are working in WPF, UWP and Xamarin.Forms XAML â€¦
